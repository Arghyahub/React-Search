# Welcome to ReactSearch
Searching is a very complicated process and requires a lot of string manipulation yet being inefficient.

A large problem being that Searching takes a lot of time and hard work to implement.


### Here I'm creating a optimal search template

- [x] High Speed 
- [x] Efficient 
- [x] Easy to Use
- [x] Modern Look
- [x] Easy to customize
- [ ] Dynamic data update



# How to use?

- Create a folder and clone the repo files
 ```bash
git clone https://github.com/Arghyahub/React-Search.git
```  
- Feed data into data.js in 2D arrays where
```cpp
datas[i][0] = "name of the link text"
datas[i][1] = "link"
```
- Import the `Search.jsx` component 

- Enclose the component in a div with position relative
```jsx
<div style={{height: "25px" , position: "relative"}}>
    <Search />
</div>

```
> Put height: height of input to avoid hiding of data
